🔴 Feature Name: Emergency BA Button
💡 Summary:
This feature connects agencies in urgent need of brand ambassadors (BAs) with available talent, fast.

Agencies post last-minute gig needs, and BAs are notified in real-time. When a BA is interested, an automated email is sent from the BA to the agency with their info, allowing the agency to follow up directly.

🧩 How It Works:
1. Agency Flow (Client-side):
Agency taps “Post Emergency Gig” button.

Form pops up requesting:

Event name

Event date & time

City + venue

Brief role description

Pay rate

Contact email (where responses should go)

Urgency (dropdown: “ASAP,” “Within 24hrs,” etc.)

Agency pays $5 to post (via Stripe or similar).

Post is submitted and stored in backend.

BAs are notified instantly.

2. BA Flow (Talent-side):
BAs get a push notification (or SMS/email) saying:

“🚨 Emergency gig posted in [City]! [Event Name] is looking for BAs on [Date]. Tap to view & express interest.”

BA taps to open gig details.

If they’re interested, they click “I’m Interested”.

This action:

Triggers a prewritten email to be sent from the BA’s profile to the agency’s contact email.

Email includes:

Subject: Emergency Gig – [BA Name] Interested in [Event Name]

Hi [Agency Name],

I saw your emergency post for [Event Name] on [Date]. I’m available and interested!

Attachments: BA’s headshots + resume (already uploaded to profile)

Email is sent from the BA's connected email account (or system-generated alias).

🛡️ Why It’s Agency-Friendly:
Agencies don’t need to download anything.

They receive professional, individualized emails from interested BAs.

No account creation required.

No stepping on toes — we’re connecting, not replacing.

✅ Benefits:
Reduces the chaos of last-minute gig dropouts.

Helps agencies access vetted, available talent fast.

Gives BAs a real shot at filling last-minute work.

Easy opt-in for both sides.
